# Major Project Proposal

## Description

Top Down game based on the idea of Lincoln RPG. 

## Must Have List

-Multiple Levels (About 5 would be good. Creating one massive map that holds 5 different levels in one place feasible?)

-A Story (Beginning, Middle, End. A purpose for the characters and what they are doing)

-Start Screen and End Screen

-Music


## Nice to Have List

-Free movement on grid while still adhering to grid rules (if needed)

-Sprite Characters

-Enemies/Bosses

-Cutscenes/Cinematic Moments??

-Different Storyline Characters (One player character, but different NPCs for you to interact with to some degree.)
