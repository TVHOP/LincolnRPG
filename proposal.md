# Major Project Proposal

## Description

Here I will describe what i'm trying to build.

## Must Have List

-Multiple Levels (About 5 would be good. Creating one massive map that holds 5 different levels in one place feasible?)

-A Story (Beginning, Middle, End. A purpose for the characters and what they are doing)

-Start Screen and End Screen

-Music

-get rid of that god forsaken bug (if needed depending on nicetohave#1)

-Different Storyline Characters (One player character, but different NPCs for you to interact with to some degree.)

## Nice to Have List

-Free movement on grid while still adhering to grid rules (if needed)

-Sprite Characters

-Enemies/Bosses

-Cutscenes/Cinematic Moments??
