## Advice to self
- Do not spend too long trying to figure out a topic
- Put in more work (spend more time)

## Hardest Part of Project
P5.Play's camera function would have been a very cool thing to have in the game. Unfortunately, I spent far too much time trying to figure it out. More than half of the work time was just trying to get the camera to function properly with what I wanted it to do.

By the time I finally decided to abandon the camera, it was already more than halfway through the project and I really trapped myself in a box. I didn't dedicate enough time to actually making the game itself. I had to create animations and 2D sprites in a very small amount of time.

My original idea for my final project was much too ambitious and I should have kept my expectations in check with reality. I spent way too much time on the camera and should have scrapped it far sooner.

## Did I complete the Needs to Have?
Short answer: No.

The Needs to Have list changed over time as I worked on the project. If you were to look at the original commit, it was much larger than what it is now. Again, I spent way too much time on the P5.Play camera, and did not spend enough time working on the actual game itself.

Close to the end of the project, I was struck down by COVID and was out of commission for a couple days. That really put a damper on my plans and cut out even more of what I had planned for the game.

To put everything plainly, my own time management was the downfall of my project, and I should have focused on the other aspects of the game rather than the camera addon.

## What am I most proud of?
Despite everything going completely off the rails, I am happy that I managed to figure out the P5.Play library on my own. It allowed me to get a really "gamey" feel going for what I would have created. I am disappointed that I wasn't able to do everything I wanted to, but I realize that it's my own mistake to work on in the future.

I will probably continue to work on this project in my own time, and get it closer to the vision I had in the beginning.

# Extras
This class has been great, and figuring out how video games (and other digital media) works has been very cool. 

When I took the class last year, I was basically forced into the class because my schedule was pretty empty. I wasn't prepared to take the class and was pretty overwhelmed with the information overload.

I came back to the class this year and I feel like I did substantially better than previously. I really enjoyed all the cool examples we created in class. Thanks for the great class and good luck in the future.
